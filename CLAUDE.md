# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and any other AI agent) working in this repo.

## What this repo is

**`claude-platform-playbook`** — executive-grade decision tools for AI transformation **on the Claude platform**. Audience: CIOs, CDOs, CTOs, CHROs sizing Claude adoption + architects defending the choice to leadership.

Public, CC-BY-4.0, vendor-explicit, decision-oriented. **Not** Anthropic marketing recap. Pin to current Claude model surface (Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 5 / Haiku 4.5 as of 2026-07) — refresh monthly.

There is no build system or test suite. This is a content repo of static HTML + Markdown.

## Session-start protocol

**Before any tool calls beyond orientation:**

1. Read [`scratch/NEXT_SESSION.md`](scratch/NEXT_SESSION.md) — resume bookmark (HEAD, recent landings, backlog with triggers, "things to NOT do without explicit instruction"). `scratch/` is gitignored; this is the user's personal aid.
2. Read [`LESSONS_LEARNED.md`](LESSONS_LEARNED.md) — process lessons compound; re-reading prevents repeat misses.
3. Read this file (CLAUDE.md) — repo posture, tone, things to avoid.
4. `git status` + `git log --oneline -5` — confirm state matches the bookmark's HEAD.
5. Only then ask the user what they want to work on.

This protocol is repeated in `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` as the canonical reference.

## Single source of truth

**`docs/feature-inventory.md`** is the canonical list of every Claude platform feature, model, status, pricing, and doc URL. The `Used in artifacts` column maps each row to the downstream artifacts that cite it.

**Refresh ritual:** edit `feature-inventory.md` first. Then grep `Used in artifacts` to find every file that needs to follow. Then bump as-of stamps. The monthly refresh routine (first Monday of each month) automates this — see `https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_019PnZmQxwkS5r9iLU9aWthe`.

**Never** edit an artifact's feature claim without updating `feature-inventory.md` in the same change.

## Working in this repo

### When adding/updating content

1. **Check `docs/feature-inventory.md` first.** If the change touches a Claude feature/model/pricing, edit the inventory row first.
2. **Cite primary sources.** All technical claims link to `docs.claude.com` or `anthropic.com/pricing` with the as-of date stamped. Never paraphrase Anthropic marketing copy verbatim.
3. **Pin specific versions** in current-state references (Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5) but **structurally pin to family** ("current Sonnet tier") in the few places that document long-term posture (governance overlay, adoption playbook). Specific versions = current; family pins = stable interface.
4. **Bump as-of stamps** on every file you touch. Use the `/bump-as-of` slash command for sweeps.
5. **Cross-link** between artifacts using relative paths (`adoption-playbook.md` → `governance-overlay.md`). Don't break the audience map in `README.md`.

### When adding a new artifact

Don't, without updating `docs/scope.md` first. The original scope agreed 8 artifacts; the repo currently ships 46 (all post-v1 additions are justified in `scope.md`). New artifacts need a written justification block in `scope.md` and a row in `feature-inventory.md`'s `Used in artifacts` column.

### When the model surface changes

A new model release (e.g., Opus 4.9) is **not** a routine inventory edit — it's a breaking change to every artifact's "current model" reference. Process:
1. Update `feature-inventory.md` model table
2. Search-replace old version → new in every artifact (use `Grep -l` to enumerate)
3. Update README footer
4. Run `/bump-as-of` for the as-of stamps
5. PR with diff list — sponsor reviews

### When pricing changes

Edit both `feature-inventory.md` Models table **and** `artifacts/cost-calculator.html` `PRICING` const + visible pricing table. Both must match. The `As of` stamp on the calculator is load-bearing — users decide budgets from this number.

## Tone constraints

- **Decision frame first, features second.** Every artifact answers a decision an executive is making, not "here's a Claude feature."
- **Numeric where possible.** Cost bands, percent reductions, time-to-value windows. No adjectives doing numeric work ("massive cost savings" is a fail).
- **Pros + cons for every recommendation.** No tool, model, or pattern is universally best. Always name the failure mode.
- **No Anthropic-marketing register.** "Claude is the most advanced AI" — not in this repo. "Sonnet 5 with prompt caching cuts steady-state cost 60–80% vs. naive use" — yes.
- **Footer pattern (consistent across all artifacts):** `© gmanch94 · CC-BY-4.0 · As of YYYY-MM. Verify pricing/models at anthropic.com.`

## Hand-drawn SVG style (reference-architectures.html only)

Diagrams use Caveat + Patrick Hand fonts and slightly imperfect path geometry to feel hand-drawn rather than corporate-clean. When adding diagrams: keep the same color taxonomy (user=orange, claude=brown, tool=blue, store=green, output=dark-orange) and the legend at top. Don't switch to Mermaid or other generators without scope-doc update.

## Companion repos (referenced from README)

- `ai-architect-showcase` — vendor-neutral AI strategy artifacts
- `ai-enablement-ws` — architect-grade operational reference

These exist; don't duplicate their content here. This repo's job is **Claude-specific** decision tooling.

## Automation

- **Monthly refresh routine** (`trig_019PnZmQxwkS5r9iLU9aWthe`): first Monday of each month, audits `feature-inventory.md` against `docs.claude.com` + `anthropic.com/pricing`, opens a PR if drift detected. Manage at https://claude.ai/code/routines.
- **`/bump-as-of` slash command:** sweeps `As of YYYY-MM` stamps across all artifacts. Use for the monthly refresh sweep.
- **`/stale-check` slash command:** read-only audit of as-of stamps, model pins, product-surface status, URL health, and feature-inventory cross-refs.
- **`/render-fix` slash command:** thin wrapper over the global `check-md` skill (`~/.claude/skills/check-md/`), which finds + fixes kramdown/GitHub-Pages render gotchas in published `.md` — stray-pipe phantom tables (` | ` between cells mis-parses as a table; invisible in source, only shows on the live HTML), plus table-spacing / 4-space-indent traps — then render-verifies on the live page. Run before/after shipping any `.md` with inline pipes. Full rule: `~/.claude/rules/markdown-render-gotchas.md`.
- **`/doc-verify` slash command:** thin wrapper over the global **`doc-verify`** skill (`~/.claude/skills/doc-verify/`) — read-only **claim-level** fact-check of a config/claim-dense artifact against the live doc it cites (`curl <url>.md` → diff). Catches the class `/stale-check` misses — a wrong *value* behind a healthy URL + current stamp (precedent 2026-07-12: `disableBypassPermissionsMode: true` vs the doc's `"disable"`). Extracts atomic claims (config keys+values, env defaults, version pins, exact paths, enum/string sentinels), fetches the `.md` doc variant, emits MATCH / MISMATCH / UNVERIFIED — **every verdict carries a verbatim live-doc quote; UNVERIFIED ≠ wrong, never auto-edited** (guards against the stale-snapshot false-negatives a free-floating doc-agent produces; presence-checked with `grep -o` before the quote to dodge long-line collisions). The wrapper supplies this repo's claim-dense target set + `docs.claude.com` host; the global skill owns the procedure. Run when a claim-dense artifact changes or before a release. Complements `/stale-check` (metadata), monthly refresh (inventory), `/render-fix` (render).

## Things to avoid

- Adding OpenAI/Gemini cost comparisons to `cost-calculator.html` — explicit decision: Claude-only.
- Replacing hand-drawn SVG with Mermaid in `reference-architectures.html` — explicit decision: hand-drawn.
- Using floating model aliases ("latest Claude") in production-facing copy — pin specific versions or family.
- Editing `LICENSE`.
- Adding emojis to artifacts unless explicitly requested.
